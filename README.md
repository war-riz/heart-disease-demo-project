# Heart Disease Demo Project

## Overview
The Heart Disease Demo Project is a machine learning application designed to predict heart disease risk based on patient health data. This project serves as a **practical demonstration** developed during a **machine learning workshop** conducted by **Ishan Mishra from DevTown**.

The model is trained using classification techniques to analyze medical attributes and provide predictions that can assist in cardiovascular health assessment. This implementation showcases fundamental ML concepts including data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment considerations.

> **Note**: This is an educational project created for learning purposes and should not be used for actual medical diagnosis.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning for heart disease datasets
- Training ML models for heart disease prediction
- Model evaluation with accuracy metrics and confusion matrix
- Feature importance analysis
- Exporting trained model for reuse
- Easy-to-use interface via Jupyter Notebook
- Visualization of data insights and model performance

## Technologies Used

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/war-riz/heart-disease-demo-project.git
   cd heart-disease-demo-project
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate    # On Linux/Mac
   venv\Scripts\activate       # On Windows
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Option 1: Google Colab (Recommended)
1. Open the notebook in Google Colab
2. Run all cells step by step
3. Upload your dataset when prompted
4. View results and visualizations

### Option 2: Local Jupyter Notebook
1. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
2. Open `heart_disease_predictor.ipynb`
3. Run the notebook cell by cell
4. Train the model and generate predictions

## Example Workflow
1. **Load Dataset** - Import heart disease dataset
2. **Data Exploration** - Analyze data distribution and correlations
3. **Data Preprocessing** - Handle missing values, encode categorical variables
